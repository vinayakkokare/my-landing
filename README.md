# Responsive Landing Page – Next.js + Tailwind CSS

This is a responsive landing page built as part of the AutoBotWA Frontend Assignment.  
The project uses **Next.js (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vercel v0** to generate UI components efficiently.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)

- Vercel v0 (for UI generation)
- Deployed on Vercel

## Features Implemented
- Hero Section (Heading, Subtext, CTA)
- Features Section (3 feature items)

## Vercel v0 Usage (Short Notes)
I used Vercel v0 to accelerate UI generation during development:
- Generated the initial Hero and Features section layouts using v0 component templates.
- Tested multiple CTA/button styles and spacing presets using v0 visual previews.
- Exported the v0-generated markup and converted it into Tailwind-based components.
- Used v0 to quickly iterate layout variations before finalizing responsive behavior.
